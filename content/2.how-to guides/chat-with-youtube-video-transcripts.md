You can drag and drop YouTube video links directly into the chat input box and start chatting with the fetched transcripts.

Alternatively, you can also paste links (space seperated) or drag and drop them in the chat attachment's YouTube Links tab.

Msty will show the number of YouTube links attached on top of the chat input box. You can choose which videos to chat with by selecting and unselecting the video thumbnails from the attachments tab.

You can start chatting with the video transcripts after Msty finishes fetching them. The video transcripts are cached which allows fast attaching in future chats.
