### Custom Search Query
The prompt you provide to a model may not be the best search query for search engines. This might cause irrelevant links to be fetched for the Real-Time Data augmentation.

Use this option as if you are searching something on Google or any other search engine. Then in the chat input prompt, ask a question relevant to the topic. This ensures that the model can get the most relevant data to answer from and a good prompt to respond to.

### Limit by Domain
Use this option if you only want to see search results from a specific site or domain.

### Extra Operators
Use this option if you want to further narrow your search results based on website content, related sites, etc.

### Before and After Dates
Set before and after dates to only include search results from a specific time.
