title: Add Models Not Included in Registry
description: Add models that are not included in the model registry to Msty
---

Msty comes with a model registry that includes a variety of models from different providers. We also regularly update the registry with new models, which you can fetch without updating the app.
First make sure to get the latest models info by going to `Settings` -> `General` -> `Models Info` > `Fetch Models Info`.

If the model you want to use is still not available, you can add it manually. This guide will show you how to add models that are not included in the model registry.

Follow the steps below to add a new model

  ### Add a Model
  You can add any models as necessary. You just need to get the id of the model from the provider such as `chatgpt-4o-latest`. Here, we are adding `Meta-Llama-3.1-405B-Instruct` as a custom model from SambaNova but process is exactly the same for other providers.

  Once you are done adding models, click the Add button on the bottom right.
