Now, you can export the chats you had with the models in either 'JSON' or 'Markdown' formats. The chats can either be copied or saved as a file in one of the before mentioned formats.

To export a chat, just navigate to the chat menu option and go to the export chat item to open the sub-menu for all the possible actions.

Also, if only some specified conversation need to be exported, you can also cherry pick those using the 'Cherry Picking Mode'. On enabling the cherry picking mode, the conversations can be selected through the checkbox and then be exported.
