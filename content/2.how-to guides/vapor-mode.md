Vapor Mode is designed for users who need quick, temporary interactions with the AI without the concern of data retention. This feature addresses privacy concerns by ensuring that no personal information or conversation history is saved after the session concludes. Whether you’re seeking immediate answers, testing concepts, or just need a brief interaction, Vapor Mode offers a secure and efficient solution for short-term use.

To activate Vapor Mode, simply toggle the option in the new chat options menu or use the shortcut (`Ctrl+⇧+N` / `⌘+⇧+N`).
