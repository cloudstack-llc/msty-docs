Enable local AI service logs on your device to help in the debugging process. To enable the logs, just go to the Local AI settings and toggle the 'Capture Service Logs' and save the changes.

The captured logs can be viewed from the path specified in the App Logs section, and also advanced configurations can be made by using JSON to set environment variables for the Local AI service.

We do recommend enabling the logs only when necessary and to disable it after use, just toggle the logs off and save the changes.
