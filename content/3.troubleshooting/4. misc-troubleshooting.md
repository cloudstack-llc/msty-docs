> When using an imported Workspace with API keys, I get a key error something like "Error while decrypting the ciphertext".

For security reasons, Msty saves your API keys in the keychain of your device. When you create a new Workspace, you have the option to copy the API keys from the current Workspace to the new Workspace. When using this Workspace on another device, by default, you will need to re-enter the API keys manually otherwise you'll get an error when trying to use an API key. Ease of convenience or security is a trade-off here and you can choose what works best for you.

To avoid re-entering the API keys on every device, you can choose to save the API keys **unencrypted** in the Workspace folder. This option is available when you add a new API key or edit an existing API key. Just uncheck `Save key securely in keychain` option when adding or editing an API key. Keep in mind that this needs to be done **before** you create the Workspace and import it to another device.
