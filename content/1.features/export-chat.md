## **Export as Markdown**  
Users can export the active chat branch as a **Markdown** file, which can be used for easy reading and formatting in various text editors.

## **Export as JSON** :aurum-tag

For more detailed and structured data, **Aurum** users can export the active branch as a **JSON** file. This format is useful for preserving metadata and structure in a machine-readable format.

## **Cherry-Pick Individual Messages** :aurum-tag  
Users can select specific messages from the chat and export them individually, giving them granular control over what gets saved.

## **Export All Branches (Full Chat Tree) in JSON** :aurum-tag  
If a user wants to export the entire chat with all its branches, this is available exclusively to **Aurum** users in the **JSON** format. This option captures the full conversation, including branches, making it ideal for comprehensive archiving.
