Msty's Real-Time Data feature allows you to fetch live data from the internet and use it to enrich your chat conversations. You can easily toggle this feature on or off as needed.

#### How to enable Real-Time Data

Click the globe icon inside the chat input box to enable the Real-Time Data feature. When this feature is enabled, Msty retrieves information from the internet and provides it to the model for enhanced context in your conversations.

## Search Provider :aurum-tag

You have the option to select a search provider to tailor the data fetching process. Supported providers include:

- **Google**
- **Brave**
- **Ecosia**

By default, the provider is set to **Auto with Fallback**, which will automatically choose a provider and switch to another if one doesn't respond. You can also choose a provider manually and save it as the default for future chats.

To choose a search provider and make further customizations, :shortcut{value="meta"} :shortcut{value="Click"} on the globe icon.

## Advanced Options :aurum-tag

The following advanced options are available for customizing your Real-Time Data search:

- **Custom Search Query**: Modify the search query to improve the quality of results. This can be helpful if the AI model's prompt isnâ€™t an optimal search query.
- **Limit by Domain**: Restrict your search to a specific domain (e.g., nasa.gov) to narrow down the results.
- **Extra Operators**: Add special search operators, such as `site:` or `intitle:`, for more precise search results.
- **Date Range**: Use the **After Date** and **Before Date** selectors to limit the search results to a specific time frame.

These advanced options give you more control over how Real-Time Data is fetched and integrated into your chat.
